# Advent of Code 2024
Solutions to Advent of Code 2024 written in Elixir.

I think events like Advent of Code are a good excuse to lear new languages, improve on known ones, and having fun in the process.

I installed Elixir for first time just for participating in AoC 2024. It's my first approach to the language, so I'm just a newby learning how it works.

So don't take these solutions too seriously. Even if they work, I'm sure the code written by an Elixir expert would be more concise and simple.
